# Slantsual — 3D Architectural Visualizations Portfolio

Welcome to **Slantsual**, a 3D Architectural Visualization Portfolio built by the team at **CodeXDevelopers**.  
This project was created strictly for **educational and internal collaboration practice purposes**.

We recreated a Figma design (sourced from the Figma Community) to:
- Improve frontend skills using **Tailwind CSS** and **Vite**
- Practice team workflows including GitHub **branching**, **merge conflicts**, **pull requests**, and **code reviews**

> ⚠️ **NOTICE**: This project is **not for commercial use**, **not to be cloned**, **not to be distributed**, or **used in any public or private products** without explicit permission from the authors.
